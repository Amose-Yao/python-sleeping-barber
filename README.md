Sleeping Barber Problem - In Python
======================

I just started playing around with Python programming and wanted something fun to program so I put together this solution 
for the sleeping barber problem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem).

As I am no expert in multithreading this is propably not the best solution and can of course be solved 
in many different ways. 

I wanted to have the solution object oriented and try and do the synchronization myself instead of using eg. 
the Queue class (http://docs.python.org/2/library/queue.html) for the waiting customers.
